# Architecture Overview

## Technical Decisions

### Core Technologies

1. **React (18.3.1)**
   - Chosen for its robust ecosystem and component-based architecture
   - Excellent developer tooling and community support
   - Efficient rendering with the latest concurrent features

2. **Tailwind CSS**
   - Utility-first approach enabling rapid UI development
   - Highly customizable design system
   - Optimal performance through purging unused styles
   - Built-in responsive design utilities

3. **Framer Motion**
   - Production-ready animation library
   - Smooth, physics-based animations
   - Gesture support and interactive animations
   - Optimized performance

### Development Environment

- **Vite**: Modern build tool offering superior development experience and fast HMR
- **ESLint**: Maintaining code quality and consistency
- **PostCSS**: Advanced CSS processing with modern features

## Future Considerations

### For UX Team
- Implementation of a comprehensive design system in Figma would streamline development
- Tailwind configuration could be better aligned with design tokens

### For Frontend Team
- Consider migrating to Next.js for:
  - Enhanced SEO capabilities
  - Optimized image handling with next/image
  - Improved Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) management
  - Server-side rendering benefits

### Design Optimization Suggestions
- Header design could be enhanced with parallax scrolling effects, eg an "introducing" text that hides under a sofa while user scrolls.
- Text elements could interact with scroll positions for dynamic visual appeal
- Consider implementing progressive image loading for better performance

## Component Architecture

Components are organized following atomic design principles:
- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs)
- **Components**: Complex, reusable UI elements
- **Layouts**: Page structure components
